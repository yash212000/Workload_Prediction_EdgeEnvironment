# Workload_Prediction_EdgeEnvironment
· Used Dask for parallel data processing of the NEP big dataset in edge environments, enabling efficient workload analysis of
edge devices.
· Enhanced data utility through feature engineering and clustering-based labeling, preparing the dataset for advanced analysis.
· Developed a specialized CNN model for edge workload classification and tested with SVM and Decision Tree
